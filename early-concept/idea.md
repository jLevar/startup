# Supreme Snail Speedway

There are four teams (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). You are randomly assigned a team for each race.

Each team has a crate they have to get to the finish line. Each team member has one snail that they can use to help
pull the crate. Since they are snails, races take hours to complete. You as the player have multiple options for your
snail. 
They can:
- Help pull your team's crate
- Pull another team's crate backward
- Earn money by pulling the lawnmower for the track's maintenance department

The more snails pulling the crate, the faster it will go. However, you can use your money to hire beetles that can move
a select amount of the other teams' snails:
- Out of the race
- Turned around to pull their crate backward
- To pull your crate forward
- Off of the lawnmower

**Gameplay and Balancing Notes**
Moving snails off the lawnmower comes at a much higher cost
The lawnmower pays out a fixed amount of cash split evenly among all those who are pulling it. 
The time of payment is randomized to prevent everyone from moving enemy snails off at the last second 


Excised Ideas
- Pickpocketing Spectators (If caught, your snail goes to jail)
- Increase the speed of your team's snails
- - Blow up a crate, eliminating a team from the race (EXPENSIVE)
