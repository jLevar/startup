Name: Supreme Snail Speedway

There are four teams (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)

You are randomly assigned a team when you make an account

Each team has a snail in a snail race. These snails will take hours to cross the finish line.
In the meantime, you can earn money that you can use to incentivize your snail, bet on other snails, and even rig the race!

The snails are pulling along a crate to the end.
You can have your snail help pull your team's crate
OR you can have it pull another team's crate backward
OR you can have it earn money by pulling the lawnmower for the track's maintenance department

Note: The lawnmower pays out a fixed amount of cash split evenly among all those who are pulling it. 
However, the time of payment is randomized to prevent everyone from moving enemy snails off at the last second 

The more snails pulling the crate, the faster it will go.
However, you can use your money to:

- Take the other teams' snails out of the race
- Move the other teams' snails around to pull the crate backward
- Move the other teams' snails to pull your crate forward 
- Blow up a crate: eliminate a team from the race
* Moving snails off the lawnmower comes at a much higher cost


Excised Ideas
- Pickpocketing Spectators (If caught, your snail goes to jail)
- Increase the speed of your team's snails
