# Notes
## 1/10/24
Today I learned how to resolve merge conflicts in Github. I also learned some new things about markdown that I didn't before.
Such as how to link to another directory: [README](/README.md)
And footnotes[^1]

[!TIP]
Continuing to refresh my knowledge and skills in markdown will lead to higher quality documentation for this project

[^1]: Such as this footnote here.
